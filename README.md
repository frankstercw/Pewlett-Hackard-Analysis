# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

As part of this analysis for Pewlett Hackard, we are assessing the potential impact of employees who are within retirement range.
We comb through several different sources of data to identify current employees that fall within the retirement range of being born between
1952 and 1955 and hired to PH between 1985 and 1988. After cleaning the data we see that there are 33,118 employees that meet these criteria.
(Please see the attached "retirement_by_title(Table1)" file for a detailed breakdown of retirement eligible employees by title.
This is a significant number of employees and we as PH must begin training and hiring strategies in anticipation of these employee exits.

To prepare for the eventual departures above, we perform an additional analysis to identify employees who can act as mentors towards others.
We select an age requirement criteria of a DOB in 1965 as the threshold for mentorship eligibility. After cleansing the data we find that PH has 1,549 
employees that can act as mentors who the next wave of PH talent. It looks like we are well positioned for the future given the depth of expertise that we 
have within the PH ranks. An additional analysis that we could perform here would be to find employees who are eligible to be mentees and replace the roles of those
who may retire shortly. Criteria of interesting for mentees could include a specific age range as well as employment tenure beyong a certain range as well.
